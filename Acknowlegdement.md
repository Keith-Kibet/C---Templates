# Acknowledgement

I would like to express my special thanks of gratitude the youtube tutor(s) as well as my capabilities and ambitions to code always which gave me the golden opportunity to do this wonderful project on the topic (The C++ walkthrough of its basic school knowledge and in Advanced Programming), which also helped me in doing a lot of Research and I came to know about so many new things I am really thankful to them.

Secondly, I would also like to thank my machine(laptop) which helped me a lot from the start to the finalizing this project within the limited time frame, even without hanging 

# Project Title : C++ in relation to Advanced Programming


 * @file main.cpp
 * @brief This is a C++ project that demonstrates the usage of XYZ feature.

 # Required Installations:
   - Linux:
    - C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
    - Build system (e.g., make or CMake)
    - IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
 
 # - Windows:
    - C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW, Visual Studio)
    - Build system (e.g., make or CMake)
    - IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks)
 
  # note
  - Make sure to install the required dependencies before running the project.
 
## Description

This project is a C++ application that demonstrates the use of classes, functions, and templates.

NOTE:The pointers are not included

## File Structure

- `/Classes`: This folder contains detailed information about classes in C++.

- `/Functions`: This folder contains detailed information about functions in C++.

- `/Templates`: This folder contains detailed information about templates in C++.

- Each folder contains its own ReadMe file

## Usage

To compile the project, navigate to the project directory and to the desired folder, then open to the Lesson_(number).
After the above, locate the file with .cpp extension and run the following command

# command 1
```bash
g++ -o filename filename.cpp
```
If the process above is successful, run this final command to execute your compiled code 

# command 2
``` bash
./filename
```

## Errors Encountered when compiling and running C++ programs

When compiling and running C++ programs, you may encounter the following errors:

1. Syntax Errors: These errors occur when the code violates the rules of the C++ language. Common syntax errors include missing semicolons, mismatched parentheses, and misspelled keywords. The compiler will provide error messages indicating the location and nature of the syntax error.

2. Linker Errors: Linker errors occur when the compiler cannot find the definitions of functions or variables that are referenced in the code. This can happen if the necessary libraries or object files are not included or if there are multiple definitions of the same symbol.

3. Runtime Errors: Runtime errors occur during the execution of the program. Common runtime errors include accessing invalid memory, dividing by zero, and using uninitialized variables. These errors can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

4. Logic Errors: Logic errors occur when the program does not produce the expected output due to incorrect logic or algorithmic mistakes. These errors can be more difficult to identify and fix, as they do not result in compiler or runtime errors.

5. Compiler Warnings: Compiler warnings indicate potential issues in the code that may not be errors but could lead to unexpected behavior. It is recommended to address these warnings to ensure the correctness and reliability of the program.

When encountering errors, it is important to carefully read the error messages provided by the compiler or runtime environment(from command 1). These messages often contain valuable information about the cause of the error and can help in troubleshooting and resolving the issue.
